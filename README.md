## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your development machine:

*   Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
*   npm (usually comes with Node.js)
*   MongoDB (local installation or a cloud-based instance like MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/cr4ck-j4ck/Nivasa.git
    cd Nivasa
    ```

2.  **Install Backend dependencies:**

    ```sh
    cd Backend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install Frontend dependencies:**

    ```sh
    cd ../Frontend
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Set up environment variables:**

    In the `Backend` directory, create a `.env` file and add the following variables. Replace the placeholder with your actual MongoDB connection string.

    ```
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/nivasa
    ```

    If you want the backend server to run on a specific port, you can also add a `PORT` variable to your `.env` file, for example:

    ```
    PORT=5000
    ```

    If you leave out the `PORT` variable, the server will default to running on port 3000.

4.  **Set up Frontend environment variables:**

    In the `Frontend` directory, create a `.env` file and add the following variables.

    ```
    VITE_LISTING_API="http://localhost:3000/listing/"
    VITE_CITY_API="http://localhost:3000/listingCard/"
    VITE_MAPTILER_KEY=<YOUR_MAPTILER_API_KEY>
    ```

    - `VITE_LISTING_API`: This variable should point to the API endpoint for fetching individual listing data.
    - `VITE_CITY_API`: This variable should point to the API endpoint for fetching listings based on a city.
    - `VITE_MAPTILER_KEY`: This variable holds your API key from [MapTiler](https://www.maptiler.com/). It is required to display maps and use geocoding features in the application. You can get a free key from the MapTiler website.

    These variables are prefixed with `VITE_` to be exposed to the frontend client-side code, as is standard with Vite projects.

5.  **Start the Backend server:**

    From the `Backend` directory:

    ```sh
    node init.js # To seed the database with initial data
    node server.js
    ```

    The backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

6.  **Start the Frontend development server:**

    From the `Frontend` directory:

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

    The frontend development server will start, and you can view the application by navigating to the URL provided in the console (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

*   `Frontend/`: Contains the React-based user interface.
*   `Backend/`: Contains the Express.js server and API logic.
